Average time and average pace is different
Average calculator method that returns average of all metrics given an arraylist of type run

Exceptions for parser and problem with calories field

method to return the fastest run given a set of parameters (we need comparable etc. etc.)

using dates, calculate daily average distance by day

move runtime formatter in class Run so that we can create a field with the formatted run time already available (? not
sure how good this is)
