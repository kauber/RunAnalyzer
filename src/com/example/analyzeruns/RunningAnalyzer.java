    // another method computes total distance run
    // another average heart rate
    // another average heart rate by distance run
    // I want to see fastest runs given a certain distance
    // convert time in seconds
    // use interface to create filters to filter the data
    // avg hr/speed and other metrics based on particular distances, i.e. average pace when run < 3 km or
    // avg hr when run > 6 km
